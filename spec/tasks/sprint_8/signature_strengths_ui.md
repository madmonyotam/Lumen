# Sprint 8: Signature Strengths UI Upgrades

## Context
Refine Step 3 of the Genesis Wizard to manage the 24 VIA strengths more effectively using category tabs and visual cues.

## Technical Constraints
- React components.
- Match design specs (screen-3.jpg notion).

## Specific Tasks
1.  **Category Tabs:**
    - Implement tabs for the 6 virtues: Wisdom, Courage, Humanity, Justice, Temperance, Transcendence.
    
2.  **Filtering Logic:**
    - Clicking a tab should filter the "Available Strengths" list to show only those belonging to the selected category.

3.  **Visual State:**
    - Strengths already assigned to the Core Hierarchy should have a visual indication (e.g., "Assigned" overlay) in the selection list.

## Definition of Done (DoD)
- [ ] Tabs for all 6 categories are visible and functional.
- [ ] Clicking a tab correctly filters the strength list.
- [ ] Assigned strengths are visually distinct/disabled in the list.
- [ ] Drag and drop functionality (if applicable) works with the filtered views.
