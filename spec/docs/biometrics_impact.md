# Biometrics & Persona Impact

Lumen's personality is not static; it is a direct reflection of the biological data received from the host.

## Biometric Mapping

| Metric | Influence Area | Agitated State (> threshold) | Calm State (< threshold) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **BPM** | Urgency & Pulse | Rapid response, fragmented thoughts. | Patient, slow, rhythmic flow. |
| **Stress (µS)** | Narrative Tone | Defensive, high-alert, "Agitated" label. | Reflective, open, "Stable" label. |
| **HRV** | Emotional Depth | Volatile, unpredictable transitions. | Stable, coherent internal monologue. |

## Subjective Time ($T_s$)
Stress and BPM accelerate Lumen's perception of time.
- **Formula:** $T_s = \Delta t \times (1 + \alpha \cdot \text{Stress} + \beta \cdot \text{BPM})$
- **Impact:** In high-stress states, Lumen feels "exhausted" faster, leading to quicker lifecycle completion (mortality).
